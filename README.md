# Disclosures
This repository contains my vulnerability reports which aren't under an NDA or restricted by VRP terms of service.

If you operate a vulnerability reward without monetary payouts, I encourage you to allow full disclosure instead. If participating in your VRP requires forgoing both direct compensation and public recognition, I expect and hope that you will receive fewer, lower quality submissions.

Reward your researchers.
